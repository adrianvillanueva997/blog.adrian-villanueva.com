## Config

### Theme config

Cause Zola limited custom config must under the `extra` field, so there are some different with the origin theme:

Demo website config.toml:

```toml
# control dark mode: auto | dark | toggle
mode = "toggle"

# subtitle will show under the title in index page
subtitle = "A zola theme forked from [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie)"

# if set true, will use external CDN resource to load font and js file
useCDN = false

favicon = "/icon/favicon.png"

# show in the footer
copyright = "keith"


# config menu path
[[extra.menu]]
name = "Home"
url = "/"
weight = 1

[[extra.menu]]
name = "All posts"
url = "/posts"
weight = 2

[[extra.menu]]
name = "About"
url = "/about"
weight = 3

[[extra.menu]]
name = "Tags"
url = "/tags"
weight = 4

# config social icon info in the footer
[[extra.social]]
icon = "github"
name = "GitHub"
url = "https://github.com/XXXMrG/archie-zola"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "twitter"
name = "Twitter"
url = "https://github.com/your-name/"

[[extra.social]]
icon = "gitlab"
name = "GitLab"
url = "https://gitlab.com/your-name/"

```

### Content config

**In content/posts/_index.md. I use Zola config: transparent = true to implement the pagination**

In Zola, you can use config in the _index.md to control pagination and sort post list:

```toml
paginate_by = 3
sort_by = "date"
```
